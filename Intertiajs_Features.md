## Intertia.JS Features

---

Inertia.js is a JavaScript library that allows you to build modern, single-page web applications without the complexity of traditional SPAs. It does this by leveraging existing server-side patterns and technologies.

### Here are some of the key features of Inertia.js:

---

- Client-side routing: Inertia.js provides client-side routing without requiring a JavaScript framework. This allows you to make page visits without forcing a full page reload.

* Server-side rendering: Inertia.js renders pages on the server, which results in faster initial load times and better SEO.
* Page components: Inertia.js uses page components to render pages. Page components are JavaScript components that are responsible for rendering the HTML and handling the interactions for a page.
* Inertia requests: Inertia requests are HTTP requests that are made to the server to fetch the data and components for a page.
* Inertia responses: Inertia responses are JSON responses that are returned from the server with the data and components for a page.

### In addition to these core features, Inertia.js also offers a number of other features, such as:

---

- Inertia links: Inertia links are a lightweight wrapper around normal anchor links. When you click an Inertia link, Inertia intercepts the click and makes a visit to the linked page via XHR instead.

* Inertia middleware: Inertia.js provides a number of middleware that can be used to customize the behavior of Inertia applications. For example, you can use middleware to authenticate users, authorize requests, and cache responses.
* Inertia events: Inertia.js provides a number of events that you can listen to in order to respond to changes in your application. For example, you can listen to the page:visited event to update your application's state when a new page is visited.
